# Breast-Cancer-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning

A Logistic regression model using Scikit-learn to classify breast cancer as either Malignant or Benign. I have used the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set from Kaggle. Main goal is to use a simple logistic regression classifier for cancer classification. The model that was created gave an accuracy of 97%.

data.csv is the data that is used
breast_cancer_prediction.ipynb contains the code for the project
